# ⚠️ This is not the full version of MSMaker

## This only includes the Office activation to prevent Windows Security false alarms

As Windows Security (and other antivirus software) may detect the full version as:

- `PUA:Win32/Puwaders.C!ml`
- `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml`

These are **false positives** caused by:

- Windows activation components (e.g., modifying `sppsvc`, `ClipSVC`, or registry keys)
- Batch files (`*.bat` / `*.cmd`) being inherently powerful (and thus often flagged)

> 🔹 **This does NOT mean the file is malicious.**  
> 🔹 The code is open-source and safe if downloaded from the official repository.

## Need activation for Windows?

### ✅ Use the full version (might trigger Windows Security)

**[MSMaker](https://github.com/Office-Maker/MSMaker)**

- Includes Windows activation (causes false positives in windows security)

---

## Note!

- No matter which download you choose, and even if Windows Security is disabled when running the batch file,  
  Windows will display a warning like **"Windows protected your PC"**.  
  This **always** occurs when running batch files downloaded from the internet and has nothing to do with potential risks or malware detections.  
  Since batch scripts are very powerful, Windows will **always** warn you before running them.

> 🔹 **This is normal. Proceed if you trust the source.**
